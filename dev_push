I am just trying to figure out how to navigate branches.
My first pull request is from a patch-1 branch I made somehow,
and it goes to the Dev branch. The second pull request goes from 
my Desktop master branch to the Dev branch, and now I wanted to 
try going from my Dev branch to the original Dev branch.
